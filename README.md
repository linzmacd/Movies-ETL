# Movie Database ETL Pipeline

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to create an automated ETL pipeline that takes three inputs (Wikipedia JSON file, Kaggle metadata, and MovieLens ratings CSV), generates DataFrames with comprehensive movie and ratings information, and adds the cleaned DataFrames to SQL databases. This function can be used to update the SQL databases daily with ease and efficiency.
